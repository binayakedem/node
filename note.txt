3: architecture of node js


client request=>server(node.js)[request is go to (event queue)=>then goes to event loop which continuousely checks the event queue to remove the request from event queue]
there are two types of request=blocking operations(synchronous task=) and non-blocking operations(asynchronous=it is simplest)


blocking operations(syncronous) goes to thread pool(blocking operations require thread i.e. worker which return the response)


if you write blocking code then there should be wait if thread all are busy, then it should be wait till the free up the thread


that's why you must focus on the non-blocking code 




most important thing of blocking and non-blocking is that
 blocking = it always blocks the resources so that code is execute serially
 non-blocking= it does not blocks the resources so that any fast executable code will be executed and display  for instance


 console.log("q")
 fs.readFile("note.txt",(err,result)=>{
    console.log(result);
 })
 console.log("3")


 ==== result will be===
 q
 3
 and text content but if you use syncronous or blocking then result will be block to execute 3 so 
 q 
 text content
 3




 most important is =default thread no. is=4 but you can increase the thread too as no. of cores in your pc


 you can get the core length in myOs
